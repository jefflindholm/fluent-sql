# Suggestions for improving the fluent-sql library

After reviewing the code, here are some suggestions for improvement.

## 1. Use a more modern TypeScript project setup

The current project uses `ts-node` and `jest` but could benefit from a more modern setup using `swc` for faster compilation and `vitest` for a more modern and faster testing experience.

## 2. Simplify the `SqlBuilder` class

The `SqlBuilder` class is complex and could be simplified. The `updateDelete` function is doing too much and could be broken down into smaller, more manageable functions. The `buildWhere` function is also complex and could be simplified.

## 3. Improve the `SqlTable` class

The `SqlTable` class could be improved by adding a `from` method that returns a `SqlQuery` object. This would allow for a more fluent API. For example:

```typescript
const users = new SqlTable('users', [{
    ColumnName: 'id'
}, {
    ColumnName: 'username'
}, {
    ColumnName: 'password'
}]);
const query = users.from().select(users.star());
```

## 4. Improve the `SqlColumn` class

The `SqlColumn` class could be improved by adding a `from` method that returns a `SqlQuery` object. This would allow for a more fluent API. For example:

```typescript
const users = new SqlTable('users', [{
    ColumnName: 'id'
}, {
    ColumnName: 'username'
}, {
    ColumnName: 'password'
}]);
const query = users.id.from().select(users.star());
```

## 5. Improve the `SqlWhere` class

The `SqlWhere` class could be improved by adding a `from` method that returns a `SqlQuery` object. This would allow for a more fluent API. For example:

```typescript
const users = new SqlTable('users', [{
    ColumnName: 'id'
}, {
    ColumnName: 'username'
}, {
    ColumnName: 'password'
}]);
const query = users.id.eq(1).from().select(users.star());
```

## 6. Remove the `string.extensions.ts` file

The `string.extensions.ts` file adds methods to the `String` prototype. This is generally considered bad practice as it can lead to conflicts with other libraries. It would be better to create a `StringUtils` class with static methods that perform the same functionality.

## 7. Add more tests

The current test suite is minimal and could be improved by adding more tests for the `SqlBuilder`, `SqlTable`, `SqlColumn`, and `SqlWhere` classes.

## 8. Add more documentation

The current documentation is minimal and could be improved by adding more documentation for the `SqlBuilder`, `SqlTable`, `SqlColumn`, and `SqlWhere` classes.

## 9. Use a linter

The code could be improved by using a linter to enforce a consistent code style.

## 10. Use a code formatter

The code could be improved by using a code formatter to enforce a consistent code style.
